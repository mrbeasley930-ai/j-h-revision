    questions:[
      {q:"Who narrates the majority of the novella?",options:["Dr Jekyll","Mr Utterson","Dr Lanyon","Mr Enfield"],answer:1,explanation:"Utterson is the focaliser. Stevenson uses his limited, rational perspective to build suspense and mirror the reader\u2019s gradual discovery."},
      {q:"In Chapter 1, what incident involving a child does Enfield describe?",options:["Hyde kidnaps a child","Hyde tramples a young girl","Hyde frightens a group of children","Hyde steals from a child"],answer:1,explanation:"Enfield witnesses Hyde colliding with and trampling a girl at a street corner, establishing Hyde as morally repugnant from the outset."},
      {q:"The novella uses a layered narrative structure. What effect does this fragmented structure create?",options:["It simplifies the plot for the reader","It mirrors the theme of duality and concealment, revealing truth gradually","It makes the story feel rushed","It focuses entirely on Jekyll\u2019s perspective"],answer:1,explanation:"Multiple narrative voices (Utterson, Lanyon, Jekyll) create a fragmented text reflecting the fragmented self. No single narrator possesses complete truth."},
      {q:"What does Utterson discover when he finally enters Jekyll\u2019s cabinet?",options:["Jekyll\u2019s dead body","Hyde\u2019s dead body in Jekyll\u2019s clothes","An empty room","Hyde, alive and hiding"],answer:1,explanation:"Hyde is found dead, wearing Jekyll\u2019s too-large clothes, having taken poison. This visual detail reinforces the physical relationship between the two identities."},
      {q:"Which event occurs FIRST in the novella?",options:["The murder of Sir Danvers Carew","The door scene described by Enfield","Dr Lanyon\u2019s death","The incident at the window"],answer:1,explanation:"The door scene (Ch.1) opens the novella. Correct order: Door scene, Carew murder, Window incident, Lanyon\u2019s death, Jekyll\u2019s statement."},
      {q:"What is the significance of Jekyll\u2019s building having two different faces?",options:["It shows Jekyll is wealthy","The respectable front and sinister rear door symbolise Jekyll\u2019s duality","It is a common Victorian architectural style","It helps Hyde escape from the police"],answer:1,explanation:"The back door faces a dingy street while the front is respectable \u2014 the building symbolises Jekyll\u2019s own duality: respectability on one side, concealed vice on the other."},
      {q:"Why does the novella withhold the truth about Jekyll and Hyde\u2019s identity until the final two chapters?",options:["Stevenson forgot to include it earlier","To create suspense and mirror Victorian society\u2019s culture of concealment","Because Jekyll only discovers the truth at the end","To keep the novella short"],answer:1,explanation:"Withholding truth replicates Victorian society\u2019s refusal to acknowledge hidden truths. The reader, like Utterson, is complicit in a gradual uncovering."},
      {q:"What does Dr Lanyon witness that causes his decline and death?",options:["Jekyll committing a crime","Hyde\u2019s transformation into Jekyll","The murder of Carew","Jekyll destroying his laboratory"],answer:1,explanation:"Lanyon witnesses Hyde drink the potion and transform. The shock of seeing the impossible \u2014 the collapse of rational science \u2014 literally kills him."},
      {q:"Which is an example of a sealed or locked document in the novella?",options:["Enfield\u2019s diary","Lanyon\u2019s letter, not to be opened until Jekyll\u2019s death","A police report","Hyde\u2019s journal"],answer:1,explanation:"Sealed documents (Jekyll\u2019s will, Lanyon\u2019s letter) defer revelation and build tension, while reflecting the culture of secrecy."},
      {q:"What genre conventions does Stevenson combine in the novella?",options:["Romance and comedy","Gothic fiction and detective fiction","Science fiction and pastoral","Satire and tragedy"],answer:1,explanation:"Gothic: doubles, dark settings, horror, the uncanny. Detective: investigation, clues, witnesses, sealed documents. Some critics also identify sensation fiction."}

The turning point: violence escalates to murder.","Ch.5 Incident of the Letter \u2014 Jekyll shows a letter from Hyde.

    questions:[
      {q:"What is Utterson\u2019s profession, and why is this significant?",options:["Doctor \u2014 he can diagnose Jekyll\u2019s illness","Lawyer \u2014 he embodies discretion, reason, and respectability","Banker \u2014 he controls Jekyll\u2019s finances","Journalist \u2014 he investigates stories"],answer:1,explanation:"Utterson\u2019s profession embodies Victorian values of discretion, reason, and respectability. Trained to uncover truths while maintaining confidentiality \u2014 ideal focaliser for a narrative about hidden identities."},
      {q:"How is Hyde\u2019s appearance described by those who encounter him?",options:["Tall, handsome but cold","Repulsive but indescribable \u2014 a \u2018haunting sense of unexpressed deformity\u2019","Ordinary and forgettable","Scarred and visibly injured"],answer:1,explanation:"Characters use terms like \u2018deformed\u2019, \u2018hardly human\u2019, \u2018troglodytic\u2019, yet cannot pinpoint a specific deformity. Evil is felt instinctively rather than seen."},
      {q:"Which character provides a genuine contrast to Jekyll\u2019s performative respectability?",options:["Mr Enfield","Mr Utterson","Dr Lanyon","Poole"],answer:1,explanation:"Utterson represents genuine self-control; Jekyll\u2019s respectability is performative. Utterson is austere, self-denying, and loyal."},
      {q:"What is Jekyll\u2019s stated motivation for creating the potion?",options:["To become immortal","To separate his dual nature so each side could \u2018go its own way\u2019","To cure a physical illness","To take revenge on his enemies"],answer:1,explanation:"Jekyll wanted to liberate darker impulses without compromising his reputation. He sought to divide the \u2018just and unjust\u2019 elements, believing each could go its own way."},
      {q:"What does the disagreement between Jekyll and Lanyon concern?",options:["A financial dispute","A romantic rivalry","Orthodox vs transgressive approaches to science","A political disagreement"],answer:2,explanation:"Lanyon represents orthodox, empirical science; Jekyll pursues \u2018transcendental\u2019 experiments Lanyon calls \u2018unscientific balderdash\u2019. Their rift dramatises conventional vs transgressive knowledge."},
      {q:"Why is Hyde physically smaller than Jekyll?",options:["He is a different person entirely","Because Jekyll\u2019s evil side had been suppressed and was \u2018less robust and less developed\u2019","Hyde is younger than Jekyll","It is never explained"],answer:1,explanation:"Jekyll explains that because he had spent less of his life indulging evil, Hyde is \u2018less robust and less developed\u2019. The suppressed side is physically smaller."},
      {q:"What role does the servant Poole play in the novella?",options:["He is the murderer","He crosses class boundaries to seek help, showing Jekyll\u2019s disintegration disrupts social order","He provides comic relief","He is Hyde\u2019s accomplice"],answer:1,explanation:"Poole crosses class boundaries by approaching Utterson for help. Servants observe what masters conceal \u2014 his alarm shows Jekyll\u2019s disintegration disrupting social order."},
      {q:"How is Sir Danvers Carew described?",options:["A young, aggressive politician","An aged, beautiful gentleman with white hair and \u2018innocent and old-world kindness\u2019","A wealthy merchant","A retired army officer"],answer:1,explanation:"His murder is particularly shocking because the victim is so gentle and defenceless, emphasising Hyde\u2019s gratuitous cruelty."},
      {q:"What does Jekyll mean by \u2018the thorough and primitive duality of man\u2019?",options:["Humans are fundamentally selfish","Within every person exist opposing forces of good and evil \u2014 this duality is fundamental, not acquired","Society creates evil through poverty","Only scientists experience duality"],answer:1,explanation:"Jekyll\u2019s phrase encapsulates the novella\u2019s central argument: duality is \u2018primitive\u2019 (fundamental) rather than acquired."},
      {q:"Why is it significant that ALL the main characters are men?",options:["Stevenson couldn\u2019t write female characters","It reflects the homosocial world of upper-class Victorian London, amplifying the theme of repression","Women were not allowed to read novels","It was required by the publisher"],answer:1,explanation:"The exclusively male cast reflects homosocial Victorian London. Women\u2019s near-total absence amplifies the theme of repression and suggests lives defined by professional bonds and unspoken codes."}

    notes:[
      {title:"Character Analysis",points:["Dr Henry Jekyll \u2014 Respected doctor tormented by tension between public respectability and private desires. Not purely good \u2014 his statement reveals vanity, ambition, desire for pleasure. Fatal flaw: believing he can separate his dual nature.","Mr Edward Hyde \u2014 Not separate but Jekyll\u2019s repressed desires given physical form. \u2018Ape-like\u2019, \u2018troglodytic\u2019, barely human. Small stature = underdevelopment of evil side. Violence escalates from trampling to murder.","Mr Gabriel John Utterson \u2014 Rational, loyal lawyer and reader\u2019s proxy. Embodies Victorian restraint. His failure to uncover truth suggests inadequacy of reason alone. Name puns on \u2018utterance\u2019 \u2014 ironic for a silent man.","Dr Hastie Lanyon \u2014 Represents conventional science. Death after witnessing transformation shows devastating effect of confronting truths that challenge rational worldviews.","Minor characters \u2014 Enfield (witness), Poole (loyal servant), Guest (handwriting clue), Carew (innocent victim marking escalation)."]}

    questions:[
      {q:"How does Stevenson suggest duality is a universal human condition?",options:["Only Jekyll experiences duality","Jekyll\u2019s experiments reveal \u2018man is not truly one, but truly two\u2019 \u2014 duality is inherent in human nature","Stevenson presents duality as a modern invention","Duality only affects scientists"],answer:1,explanation:"Stevenson argues duality is inherent. Victorian society\u2019s refusal to acknowledge this makes it more dangerous. The novella\u2019s structure mirrors this theme."},
      {q:"How does Victorian repression contribute to Hyde\u2019s existence?",options:["It has no effect","Repression eliminates desire","The demand to suppress all \u2018undignified\u2019 desires creates pressure that produces Hyde \u2014 repression concentrates desire","Victorian society openly accepted all behaviour"],answer:2,explanation:"Jekyll\u2019s attempt to live up to an impossible standard creates the pressure that produces Hyde. Repression doesn\u2019t eliminate desire \u2014 it concentrates it."},
      {q:"How does Stevenson present science in the novella?",options:["Science is entirely beneficial","Science without moral restraint is dangerous","Science is irrelevant to the plot","Scientists are presented as heroic"],answer:1,explanation:"Jekyll\u2019s experiments are a cautionary tale. Science that transgresses moral boundaries leads to catastrophe, reflecting wider Victorian anxieties."},
      {q:"How does secrecy operate as a theme?",options:["Only Jekyll keeps secrets","Secrecy pervades every level: characters, narrative structure, and buildings \u2014 Stevenson critiques Victorian hypocrisy","Secrecy is presented positively","There are no secrets in the novella"],answer:1,explanation:"Sealed letters, locked doors, unspoken suspicions. Stevenson uses secrecy to critique the gap between public respectability and private behaviour."},
      {q:"How does the London setting contribute to the themes?",options:["London is presented as entirely pleasant","Fog symbolises moral obscurity; contrasting areas reflect the duality within individuals","The setting is irrelevant","London represents scientific progress"],answer:1,explanation:"London is a city of contrasts: respectable squares beside sinister streets. Persistent fog symbolises moral obscurity. The urban landscape reflects individual duality."},
      {q:"Is Hyde a separate entity or part of Jekyll?",options:["Completely separate","Part of Jekyll \u2014 evil cannot be surgically removed; it is intrinsic","A supernatural demon","Jekyll\u2019s identical twin"],answer:1,explanation:"Though initially treated as separate, they are one person. Stevenson\u2019s point: evil cannot be surgically removed \u2014 \u2018All human beings are commingled out of good and evil.\u2019"},
      {q:"What do doors and windows symbolise in the novella?",options:["Wealth and status","Thresholds between the respectable/public and the hidden/private","Escape routes","Architectural fashion"],answer:1,explanation:"Jekyll\u2019s back door gives Hyde access without passing through the front. The window scene shows Jekyll\u2019s fa\u00e7ade cracking publicly."},
      {q:"What does the novella suggest about reputation?",options:["Reputation always reflects reality","Characters prioritise reputation above truth \u2014 Stevenson critiques a society where appearance matters more than reality","Reputation is unimportant","Only Jekyll cares about reputation"],answer:1,explanation:"Utterson suppresses suspicions to protect Jekyll\u2019s name. Jekyll creates Hyde to protect his reputation. Appearance matters more than reality."},
      {q:"Which aspect of Hyde reflects Darwinian anxieties?",options:["His intelligence and cunning","His ape-like appearance and animalistic behaviour \u2014 reflecting fears of degeneration","His wealth and status","His legal knowledge"],answer:1,explanation:"Hyde\u2019s \u2018ape-like fury\u2019 and \u2018troglodytic\u2019 appearance reflect fears that humanity could revert to a primitive state \u2014 the concept of atavism."},
      {q:"How does Stevenson challenge the idea that respectability equals morality?",options:["He doesn\u2019t challenge it","Jekyll is outwardly distinguished but inwardly harbours shameful desires \u2014 the most respectable fa\u00e7ade conceals the darkest impulses","All respectable characters are shown to be moral","Only lower-class characters are immoral"],answer:1,explanation:"Jekyll is the clearest example: outwardly a distinguished doctor, inwardly harbouring desires he considers shameful."}

    notes:[
      {title:"Themes \u2014 Detailed Notes",points:[
        "DUALITY \u2014 The central theme. Every person contains good and evil. Jekyll\u2019s experiment to separate them fails, suggesting duality is inseparable. The novella\u2019s structure (multiple narrators, concealed truths) mirrors this. Examiners reward analysis of HOW Stevenson presents duality through form, structure, and language.",
        "REPRESSION & HYPOCRISY \u2014 Victorian gentlemen suppressed pleasure, emotion, desire. Jekyll concealed pleasures with \u2018an almost morbid sense of shame.\u2019 Forced repression distorts desire into something more dangerous. Hyde is the product of repression, not science alone.",
        "SCIENCE & ITS LIMITS \u2014 Jekyll\u2019s \u2018transcendental medicine\u2019 crosses a moral line. The Lanyon\u2013Jekyll conflict dramatises debates about whether science should have moral boundaries. Stevenson warns about science without ethical restraint.",
        "SECRECY & REPUTATION \u2014 Every character keeps secrets. Sealed letters, locked doors, unspoken suspicions. Reputation valued above truth. Stevenson critiques a society where appearances take precedence over reality.",
        "URBAN GOTHIC & SETTING \u2014 London as more than backdrop. Fog, gaslit streets, wealthy squares vs sinister alleys. Jekyll\u2019s dual-faced house is the perfect architectural metaphor."

      {q:"How do real-life scandals of the period connect to the novella?",options:["They don\u2019t connect at all","Cases like Jack the Ripper (1888) reflected the same anxiety: evil hiding behind respectable exteriors","Victorian scandals were entirely fictional","Stevenson based Hyde on a specific criminal"],answer:1,explanation:"The novella anticipated real-life fears about the hidden lives of outwardly respectable men."},
      {q:"How does the novella reflect Darwinian anxieties?",options:["It doesn\u2019t reference evolution","Hyde\u2019s ape-like appearance embodies \u2018atavism\u2019 \u2014 the fear that humanity could revert to a primitive state","Darwin is mentioned by name","Jekyll uses Darwin\u2019s theories in his experiment"],answer:1,explanation:"Darwin\u2019s Origin of Species (1859) raised the possibility of evolutionary regression. \u2018Degeneration theory\u2019 (1880s\u201390s) suggested civilisation could regress."},
      {q:"Which contextual influence is correctly identified?",options:["The Industrial Revolution led to urbanisation and fears about the hidden lives of respectable men","Stevenson was reacting to the First World War","The novella was inspired by the suffragette movement","Victorian society openly encouraged self-expression"],answer:0,explanation:"Mass urbanisation created vast, anonymous cities where people could lead double lives."},
      {q:"How does the novella reflect Victorian class consciousness?",options:["Class is never mentioned","Hyde inhabits Soho (poverty/vice) while Jekyll lives in respectability \u2014 class boundaries are rigid yet permeable","All characters are working class","Class boundaries don\u2019t exist in the novella"],answer:1,explanation:"Jekyll can cross class boundaries through Hyde, but this transgression ultimately destroys him."}
