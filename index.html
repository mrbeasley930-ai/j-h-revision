    questions:[
      {q:"Who is the main focaliser through whose perspective most of the novella is narrated?",
        options:["Dr Lanyon, whose scientific knowledge guides the reader","Mr Enfield, who opens and closes the story","Dr Jekyll, who narrates his own downfall throughout","Mr Utterson, whose rational viewpoint builds suspense gradually"],answer:3,
        explanation:"Utterson is the focaliser for most of the novella. Stevenson uses his limited, rational perspective to build suspense and mirror the reader\u2019s gradual discovery."},
      {q:"In Chapter 1, what does Enfield describe witnessing at a street corner?",
        options:["Hyde trampling a young girl and showing no remorse","Hyde threatening Utterson outside his chambers","Hyde breaking into Jekyll\u2019s laboratory at night","Hyde arguing violently with a cab driver"],answer:0,
        explanation:"Enfield witnesses Hyde colliding with and trampling a girl, establishing Hyde as morally repugnant from the outset."},
      {q:"What effect does Stevenson create by using multiple narrators and embedded documents?",
        options:["It keeps the novella short and readable for a Victorian audience","It allows Stevenson to include factual historical details","The fragmented structure mirrors duality and concealment, revealing truth only gradually","It gives every character an equal share of the narrative"],answer:2,
        explanation:"Multiple narrative voices (Utterson, Lanyon, Jekyll) create a fragmented text reflecting the fragmented self. No single narrator possesses complete truth."},
      {q:"What do Utterson and Poole find when they break into Jekyll\u2019s cabinet?",
        options:["An empty room with a smashed mirror on the floor","Jekyll slumped over his desk, still breathing faintly","A letter from Hyde confessing to the murder of Carew","Hyde\u2019s body dressed in Jekyll\u2019s oversized clothes"],answer:3,
        explanation:"Hyde is found dead, wearing Jekyll\u2019s too-large clothes, having taken poison. This visual detail reinforces the physical relationship between the two identities."},
      {q:"Which of the following is the correct chronological order of events?",
        options:["Carew murder, door scene, Lanyon\u2019s death, window incident, Jekyll\u2019s statement","Door scene, Carew murder, window incident, Lanyon\u2019s death, Jekyll\u2019s statement","Jekyll\u2019s statement, door scene, Carew murder, Lanyon\u2019s death, window incident","Door scene, window incident, Carew murder, Jekyll\u2019s statement, Lanyon\u2019s death"],answer:1,
        explanation:"Correct order: Door scene (Ch.1), Carew murder (Ch.4), Window incident (Ch.7), Lanyon\u2019s death (Ch.9), Jekyll\u2019s statement (Ch.10)."},
      {q:"Why is the two-faced nature of Jekyll\u2019s building significant?",
        options:["It reflects the wealth gap between Soho and Mayfair in the 1880s","It was a common feature of Georgian townhouses across London","It provides a practical escape route for Hyde to avoid the police","The respectable front and sinister rear door mirror Jekyll\u2019s own dual nature"],answer:3,
        explanation:"The back door faces a dingy street while the front is respectable \u2014 the building symbolises Jekyll\u2019s duality: respectability on one side, concealed vice on the other."},
      {q:"Why does Stevenson delay the revelation of Jekyll and Hyde\u2019s shared identity until the final chapters?",
        options:["To build suspense and mirror Victorian society\u2019s own culture of concealment","Because Jekyll himself does not understand the connection until the end","Because the publisher required a twist ending for commercial reasons","To allow Lanyon time to conduct his own scientific investigation"],answer:0,
        explanation:"Withholding truth replicates Victorian society\u2019s refusal to acknowledge hidden truths. The reader, like Utterson, is complicit in a gradual uncovering."},
      {q:"What event does Dr Lanyon witness that ultimately causes his death?",
        options:["Jekyll confessing to the murder of Sir Danvers Carew in his study","Utterson destroying Jekyll\u2019s will in front of him at the office","Poole revealing that Jekyll has been dead for several days already","Hyde drinking the potion and transforming into Jekyll before his eyes"],answer:3,
        explanation:"Lanyon witnesses Hyde drink the potion and transform. The shock of seeing the impossible \u2014 the collapse of rational science \u2014 literally kills him."},
      {q:"Which sealed or locked document plays a key role in the novella\u2019s structure?",
        options:["Lanyon\u2019s letter, with instructions not to open it until Jekyll\u2019s death or disappearance","Enfield\u2019s written account of the trampling incident near the door","A formal police report into the Carew murder case filed at Scotland Yard","Hyde\u2019s private journal, discovered in his Soho lodgings by the police"],answer:0,
        explanation:"Sealed documents (Jekyll\u2019s will, Lanyon\u2019s letter) defer revelation and build tension, while reflecting the culture of secrecy."},
      {q:"Which two genre traditions does Stevenson combine in the novella?",
        options:["Romantic poetry and social realism about factory conditions","The Gothic tradition and the detective story","Pastoral fiction and the picaresque novel of adventure","Classical tragedy and satirical comedy of manners"],answer:1,
        explanation:"Gothic: doubles, dark settings, horror, the uncanny. Detective: investigation, clues, witnesses, sealed documents."}

    questions:[
      {q:"Utterson is a lawyer. Why does this profession make him an effective focaliser for the story?",
        options:["It means he can legally compel Jekyll to confess the truth about Hyde","Lawyers were the most common type of protagonist in Victorian fiction","His training in discretion and uncovering facts suits a narrative about hidden identities","It gives him access to Jekyll\u2019s finances and therefore control over Hyde\u2019s actions"],answer:2,
        explanation:"Utterson\u2019s profession embodies Victorian values of discretion, reason, and respectability \u2014 ideal for a narrative about hidden identities."},
      {q:"What is distinctive about the way characters describe Hyde\u2019s appearance?",
        options:["They all agree he has a prominent facial scar that makes him recognisable","They describe him as handsome but deeply unsettling in his manner and speech","They refuse to describe him at all, out of fear for their own personal safety","They find him repulsive but cannot identify any specific deformity in his features"],answer:3,
        explanation:"Characters use terms like \u2018deformed\u2019, \u2018hardly human\u2019, \u2018troglodytic\u2019, yet cannot pinpoint a specific deformity. Evil is felt instinctively rather than seen."},
      {q:"Which character serves as a genuine contrast to Jekyll\u2019s performed respectability?",
        options:["Enfield, who is sociable and unconcerned with how others see him","Lanyon, who publicly challenges Jekyll\u2019s scientific methods at every opportunity","Poole, who is devoted to Jekyll out of decades of long and loyal service","Utterson, who is austere, self-denying, and sincerely restrained in his conduct"],answer:3,
        explanation:"Utterson represents genuine self-control; Jekyll\u2019s respectability is performative. Utterson is austere, self-denying, and loyal."},
      {q:"What reason does Jekyll give for creating the potion in his \u2018Full Statement\u2019?",
        options:["He wished to separate his two natures so each could go its own way freely","He hoped to prove Lanyon wrong about the limits of orthodox medical science","He wanted to cure a degenerative illness that threatened his professional career","He intended to create a disguise that would let him escape his mounting debts"],answer:0,
        explanation:"Jekyll wanted to liberate darker impulses without compromising his reputation. He sought to divide the \u2018just and unjust\u2019 elements."},
      {q:"What is at the root of the disagreement between Jekyll and Lanyon?",
        options:["A long-standing personal grudge dating back to their university days together","Their conflicting views on whether science should have moral boundaries","Lanyon\u2019s jealousy of Jekyll\u2019s greater wealth and higher social standing","A dispute over the treatment of a shared patient at their medical practice"],answer:1,
        explanation:"Lanyon represents orthodox science; Jekyll pursues \u2018transcendental\u2019 experiments Lanyon calls \u2018unscientific balderdash\u2019."},
      {q:"Why is Hyde described as being physically smaller than Jekyll?",
        options:["Because Stevenson wanted to make Hyde seem less threatening at first glance","Because the potion only works on part of the body, leaving Hyde incomplete","Because Victorian readers would have associated small stature with lower class","Because Jekyll had spent less of his life exercising his evil side, so it was less developed"],answer:3,
        explanation:"Jekyll explains that because he had spent less of his life indulging evil, Hyde is \u2018less robust and less developed\u2019."},
      {q:"What is Poole\u2019s significance in the novella?",
        options:["He provides comic relief during the tense final chapters of the story","His crossing of class boundaries to seek help shows how Jekyll\u2019s crisis disrupts social order","He acts as Hyde\u2019s unwitting accomplice by covering for Jekyll\u2019s absences","He serves as the reliable narrator for the middle section of the novella"],answer:1,
        explanation:"Poole crosses class boundaries by approaching Utterson for help. Servants observe what masters conceal."},
      {q:"How is Sir Danvers Carew described before his murder?",
        options:["As an aged, gentle man with white hair and an air of innocent kindness","As a vigorous young politician with a fierce temper and many enemies","As a frail, elderly man confined to his home by a long and painful illness","As a shrewd businessman known for his ruthless financial dealings in the City"],answer:0,
        explanation:"Carew is described with \u2018innocent and old-world kindness\u2019 and white hair. His murder is shocking because the victim is so gentle."},
      {q:"When Jekyll refers to \u2018the thorough and primitive duality of man\u2019, what does he mean?",
        options:["That only primitive, uneducated people are truly capable of committing evil","That modern civilisation has created a split in human nature that did not exist before","That the struggle between good and evil within every person is a deep and fundamental condition","That duality is a temporary phase that science will eventually be able to overcome"],answer:2,
        explanation:"Jekyll\u2019s phrase encapsulates the novella\u2019s central argument: duality is fundamental (\u2018primitive\u2019) rather than acquired."},
      {q:"Why is it significant that all the main characters in the novella are men?",
        options:["Because Stevenson only ever wrote fiction with exclusively male characters","Because Victorian publishers would not allow female characters in horror fiction","Because the absence of women reflects a closed, repressive male world that amplifies concealment","Because women in the 1880s had no involvement whatsoever in science or the law"],answer:2,
        explanation:"The exclusively male cast reflects the homosocial world of upper-class Victorian London. Women\u2019s near-total absence amplifies the theme of repression."}

    notes:[
      {title:"Character Analysis",points:["Dr Henry Jekyll \u2014 Respected doctor tormented by tension between public respectability and private desires. Not purely good \u2014 his statement reveals vanity, ambition, desire for pleasure. Fatal flaw: believing he can separate his dual nature.","Mr Edward Hyde \u2014 Not separate but Jekyll\u2019s repressed desires given physical form. \u2018Ape-like\u2019, \u2018troglodytic\u2019, barely human. Small stature = underdevelopment of evil side. Violence escalates from trampling to murder.","Mr Gabriel John Utterson \u2014 Rational, loyal lawyer and reader\u2019s proxy. Embodies Victorian restraint. His failure to uncover truth suggests inadequacy of reason alone. Name puns on \u2018utterance\u2019 \u2014 ironic for a silent man.","Dr Hastie Lanyon \u2014 Represents conventional science.

    questions:[
      {q:"Jekyll declares that \u2018man is not truly one, but truly two.\u2019 What does the novella suggest about this duality?",
        options:["That it is a unique affliction caused by Jekyll\u2019s scientific tampering with nature","That it is an ancient and universal part of human nature, present in everyone","That it affects only those who pursue forbidden knowledge beyond proper limits","That it is a metaphor for the class divisions that existed in Victorian England"],answer:1,
        explanation:"Stevenson argues duality is inherent in human nature. Victorian society\u2019s refusal to acknowledge this makes it more dangerous."},
      {q:"How does the novella present Victorian expectations of gentlemanly conduct as contributing to Hyde\u2019s creation?",
        options:["Victorian gentlemen were encouraged to express their emotions openly and freely","Jekyll creates Hyde specifically to attend social events that he finds tedious","The pressure to suppress all improper desires does not remove them but intensifies them","Gentlemen in the 1880s were expected to pursue scientific experimentation as a hobby"],answer:2,
        explanation:"Jekyll\u2019s attempt to live up to an impossible standard creates the pressure that produces Hyde. Repression doesn\u2019t eliminate desire \u2014 it concentrates it."},
      {q:"What attitude towards science does the novella present?",
        options:["That scientific progress is always a positive force for good in society","That only working-class scientists pose any real danger to the social order","That science pursued without ethical limits leads to catastrophe and ruin","That the Church should have full authority over all forms of scientific work"],answer:2,
        explanation:"Jekyll\u2019s experiments are a cautionary tale. Science that transgresses moral boundaries leads to catastrophe."},
      {q:"How does the theme of secrecy function in the novella?",
        options:["It operates at every level \u2014 characters, structure, and settings all involve concealment","Only Jekyll and Hyde keep secrets; the other characters are fully open and honest","Secrecy is presented as a positive Victorian value that protects the innocent from harm","Stevenson uses secrecy purely as a plot device with no wider thematic significance"],answer:0,
        explanation:"Sealed letters, locked doors, unspoken suspicions. Stevenson uses secrecy to critique the gap between public respectability and private behaviour."},
      {q:"What role does the London setting play in developing the novella\u2019s themes?",
        options:["London is presented as a bright, modern city representing progress and hope","Stevenson chose London simply because it was where his publisher was based","London functions only as a realistic backdrop with no wider symbolic purpose","The fog and contrasting neighbourhoods reflect moral confusion and hidden duality"],answer:3,
        explanation:"London is a city of contrasts: respectable squares beside sinister streets. Persistent fog symbolises moral obscurity."},
      {q:"What does the novella ultimately suggest about the relationship between Jekyll and Hyde?",
        options:["They are the same person \u2014 evil cannot be divided from the self because it is intrinsic","Hyde is a completely separate person who has taken over Jekyll\u2019s house by force","Hyde is a supernatural creature summoned by Jekyll\u2019s forbidden experiments","Jekyll invented Hyde as a fictional persona to mislead his friends and colleagues"],answer:0,
        explanation:"Though initially treated as separate, they are one person. Evil cannot be surgically removed \u2014 it is intrinsic."},
      {q:"What do doors and windows represent in the novella?",
        options:["The physical barriers that prevent Utterson from solving the case sooner","Victorian architectural fashions of the 1880s in the wealthier parts of London","The entrances to heaven and hell, following a strict religious allegory throughout","The boundaries between the public, respectable world and the hidden, private one"],answer:3,
        explanation:"Jekyll\u2019s back door gives Hyde access without passing through the front. The window scene shows Jekyll\u2019s fa\u00e7ade cracking publicly."},
      {q:"How does the novella present the concept of reputation?",
        options:["Reputation is shown to be unimportant to all the main characters in the story","Characters consistently value maintaining their public image above discovering the truth","Only Hyde is concerned about his reputation within fashionable Victorian society","Stevenson suggests that a strong reputation is always deserved and fully reliable"],answer:1,
        explanation:"Utterson suppresses suspicions to protect Jekyll\u2019s name. Jekyll creates Hyde to protect his reputation."},
      {q:"Hyde is described as having \u2018ape-like fury\u2019 and a \u2018troglodytic\u2019 manner. What contemporary fear does this reflect?",
        options:["The widespread fear of escaped zoo animals in 1880s London boroughs","The Victorian anxiety that humanity could regress to a more primitive state","A belief that all criminals were physically different from law-abiding citizens","The concern that foreign immigration was changing British culture irreversibly"],answer:1,
        explanation:"Hyde\u2019s animalistic appearance reflects fears of degeneration \u2014 the idea that humanity could reverse its evolutionary progress."},
      {q:"How does Stevenson challenge the assumption that outward respectability reflects inner goodness?",
        options:["He shows that Jekyll, the most distinguished figure in the story, harbours the darkest impulses","He doesn\u2019t challenge it \u2014 the respectable characters are all shown to be genuinely moral","He argues that only the working classes are truly capable of immoral behaviour","He presents Hyde as more respectable than Jekyll by the end of the novella"],answer:0,
